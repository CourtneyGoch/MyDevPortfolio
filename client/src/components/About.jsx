          I'm a front-end (soon to be a full-stack) developer who has a penchant
          for creating amazing websites, building and playing games, reading
          books, listening to podcasts, exploring new perspectives and ideas,
          going out for hikes, and writing. I'm also working on developing my
          skills in the fascinating fields of Artificial Intelligence and 3D
          Web Development.
